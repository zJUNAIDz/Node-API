# Node API Repository with CRUD Operations, Validation, and MVC Design

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

To create a Node.js API repository with CRUD operations, client request validation using JOI, database validation using Mongoose, MongoDB for data storage, and following MVC design patterns with API versioning (v1 in routes), you can structure your project as follows:

1. **Project Structure:**
   - Create folders for models, controllers, routes, and middleware.
   - Implement MVC design patterns, separating concerns.

2. **API Versioning:**
   - Use API versioning in routes, such as `/v1/your-endpoints`.

3. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implement routes and controllers for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
   - Utilize Mongoose for interacting with MongoDB, following CRUD operations.

4. **Client Request Validation:**
   - Integrate JOI for validating incoming client requests.
   - Implement middleware for request validation before processing.

5. **Database Validation:**
   - Leverage Mongoose to enforce schema and perform database validations.
